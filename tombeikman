        <h2>In a few sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
        <p>I live in Rochester, New Hampshire.  My wife and I have one daughter.  I work at IBM in software development and specialize in API test and automation.</p>
        <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
        <p>I am interested in pursuing the masters degree program in digital media and instructional design offered by the extension school.  This is my third class and I will apply for the program later this fall.</p>
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
        <p>I program in Java almost daily, and have a fair amount of programming in my 15 years at IBM (Java, Jython, Ant, and way way back, C).  Lots of source control experience too (CVS, ClearCase UCM, and Rational RTC). </p>
        <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
        <p>I'll be using Windows for this course.</p>
        <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
